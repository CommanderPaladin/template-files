Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 10 March 2025

Thank you for using Pi Panda Feeder (the “App”). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and protect the personal information you provide when you access or use our App. By using the App, you acknowledge and agree to the practices described herein.
1. Who We Are

Pi Panda Feeder (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is an application that enables users to feed a virtual panda using Pi as a form of payment. It integrates with the Pi Network for user authentication and transaction processing.


2. Information We Collect

    Pi Account Details
        When you log in through the Pi Browser, we receive your Pi username, a unique user ID, and your wallet address from Pi Network’s authentication process. We do not collect any private keys or passwords.

    Transaction Data
        We may store information about your transactions within the App, such as the amount of Pi spent on feeding the panda, the transaction ID, and the status of each payment.

    Usage Information
        We may collect basic analytics (e.g., which pages or features you visit, timestamps, error logs) to improve the App’s performance and user experience. This data is typically aggregated and does not directly identify you.

    Database Records
        We keep records of how much Pi the panda has received and who has fed the panda. This may include your Pi username and Pi transaction details.

3. How We Use Your Information

    Enabling App Functionality
        We use your Pi Network credentials (username, wallet address) to authenticate you and process feed transactions to the virtual panda.

    Payment Processing
        We integrate with Pi Network’s official payment APIs to carry out Pi transactions. We log transaction statuses to confirm whether the panda has been successfully fed.

    Analytics and Improvements
        General usage information (like page visits or error logs) helps us diagnose issues, enhance features, and ensure a smooth user experience.

    Communication
        We may use your Pi username or other available contact methods (if provided) to communicate essential updates regarding the App or changes to this Privacy Policy.

4. Disclosure of Information

    Service Providers
        We do not sell or rent your personal data. We only share transaction information with Pi Network’s official APIs as needed to process payments.

    Legal Obligations
        We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by government authorities.

    Business Transfers
        In the unlikely event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we may transfer user data to the new entity, which would remain subject to this Privacy Policy (or a policy that offers comparable protection).

5. Data Security

    We take precautions, such as secure connections (HTTPS) and restricted database access, to protect your data.
    No Private Keys: Our App does not request or store your Pi private key. Authentication and transaction signing happen through Pi Network’s official processes.

6. Data Retention

    We retain transaction logs (e.g., feed records) and relevant usage data for as long as necessary to operate and maintain the App.
    If you wish to request deletion of your data, please contact us at [Your Contact Email]. We will make reasonable efforts to honor such requests in line with applicable laws and technical constraints.

7. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to:

    Access or update your personal information
    Request deletion of certain data
    Object to or restrict certain forms of processing

For inquiries about exercising these rights, contact us at [Your Contact Email]. We will respond in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
8. Children’s Privacy

Our App is intended for general audiences and is not specifically directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of majority in their jurisdiction. If you believe we have unintentionally gathered such information, contact us to have it removed.
9. International Transfer of Data

We may store or process your information on servers located in different regions. By using the App, you agree that your information may be transferred to and stored in countries that may have different data protection laws than your country of residence.
10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices. If significant changes are made, we will notify you by updating the “Effective Date” above or by other appropriate means. Continuing to use the App after such updates indicates acceptance of the revised policy.


By using Pi Panda Feeder, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy, and you consent to the collection and use of your information as described herein.
